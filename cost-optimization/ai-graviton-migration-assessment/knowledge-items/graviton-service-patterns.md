# AWS Service Patterns for Graviton Migration

## Overview

This guide provides service-specific migration patterns and considerations for AWS services that support Graviton processors, based on the latest AWS documentation and proven migration patterns.

## Container Services

### Amazon ECS
**Graviton Support**: Full support for ARM64 containers
**Migration Pattern**:
```yaml
# Task Definition Updates
family: "my-app-arm64"
cpu: "256"
memory: "512"
requiresCompatibilities: ["FARGATE"]
runtimePlatform:
  cpuArchitecture: "ARM64"
  operatingSystemFamily: "LINUX"
containerDefinitions:
  - name: "my-app"
    image: "my-app:arm64"  # ARM64-specific image
```

**Key Considerations**:
- Use ARM64 base images (not multi-arch with emulation)
- Update task definitions to specify ARM64 architecture
- Ensure all sidecar containers support ARM64

### Amazon EKS
**Graviton Support**: Full support with managed node groups
**Migration Pattern**:
```yaml
# Node Group Configuration
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig
nodeGroups:
  - name: graviton-nodes
    instanceTypes: ["m6g.large", "m6g.xlarge"]
    amiFamily: AmazonLinux2
    arch: arm64
```

**Key Considerations**:
- Create separate ARM64 node groups
- Use node selectors for ARM64-specific workloads
- Ensure all Kubernetes add-ons support ARM64

### Amazon ECR
**Multi-Architecture Support**: Native support for ARM64 images
**Migration Pattern**:
```bash
# Build and push multi-arch images
docker buildx create --use
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t my-repo:latest --push .
```

## Serverless Services

### AWS Lambda
**Graviton Support**: ARM64 runtime available
**Performance Benefits**:
- Up to 34% better price-performance
- 20% lower duration charges
- Millisecond billing granularity
- Compute Savings Plans support

**Migration Pattern**:
```python
# SAM Template
Resources:
  MyFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      Runtime: python3.9
      Architectures:
        - arm64  # Specify ARM64 architecture
      Handler: app.lambda_handler
      CodeUri: src/
```

**Key Considerations**:
- Test all dependencies for ARM64 compatibility
- Update deployment packages for ARM64
- Monitor cold start performance (often improved)
- Consider separate ARM64 deployment pipeline

## Database Services

### Amazon RDS
**Graviton Support**: Available for multiple database engines
**Supported Engines**:
- PostgreSQL (recommended for Graviton)
- MySQL
- MariaDB

**Migration Pattern**:
```yaml
# RDS Instance with Graviton
DBInstanceClass: db.r6g.large  # Graviton-based instance
Engine: postgres
EngineVersion: "15.3"  # Use latest for best ARM64 performance
```

**Performance Considerations**:
- PostgreSQL shows excellent Graviton performance
- MySQL 8.0.23+ includes ARM64 optimizations
- Monitor query performance during migration

### Amazon ElastiCache
**Graviton Support**: Redis and Memcached on Graviton
**Migration Pattern**:
```yaml
# ElastiCache with Graviton
CacheNodeType: cache.r6g.large
Engine: redis
EngineVersion: "7.0"
```

## Compute Services

### Amazon EC2
**Instance Families**: Comprehensive Graviton instance coverage
**Migration Mapping**:
```yaml
# Common x86 to Graviton mappings
x86_to_graviton:
  m5.large: m6g.large      # General purpose
  c5.large: c6g.large      # Compute optimized  
  r5.large: r6g.large      # Memory optimized
  t3.medium: t4g.medium    # Burstable performance
```

**Key Considerations**:
- Use latest generation Graviton instances (Graviton3/4)
- Consider memory and network performance differences
- Plan for different pricing models

### AWS Batch
**Graviton Support**: ARM64 compute environments
**Migration Pattern**:
```yaml
# Batch Compute Environment
computeEnvironmentName: "graviton-batch-env"
type: MANAGED
state: ENABLED
computeResources:
  type: EC2
  instanceTypes: ["m6g", "c6g", "r6g"]
  imageId: "ami-arm64-optimized"
```

## Storage and Content Delivery

### Amazon S3
**Graviton Compatibility**: Fully compatible (no changes needed)
**Performance**: Same performance characteristics

### Amazon CloudFront
**Graviton Compatibility**: Fully compatible (no changes needed)
**Performance**: Same performance characteristics

## Networking Services

### Application Load Balancer
**Graviton Compatibility**: Fully compatible
**Performance**: Same performance characteristics

### Network Load Balancer  
**Graviton Compatibility**: Fully compatible
**Performance**: Same performance characteristics

## Migration Patterns by Workload Type

### Microservices Architecture
**Pattern**: Gradual service-by-service migration
```yaml
migration_phases:
  phase1: "Stateless services with minimal dependencies"
  phase2: "Services with well-tested ARM64 dependencies"  
  phase3: "Services requiring custom builds or optimization"
```

### Monolithic Applications
**Pattern**: Blue-green deployment with ARM64 environment
```yaml
migration_approach:
  preparation: "Build ARM64-compatible version"
  testing: "Parallel ARM64 environment for validation"
  cutover: "DNS/load balancer switch to ARM64"
```

### Data Processing Workloads
**Pattern**: Batch job migration with performance validation
```yaml
migration_steps:
  validation: "Test data processing accuracy"
  performance: "Benchmark processing speed and cost"
  scaling: "Validate auto-scaling behavior"
```

## Cost Optimization Patterns

### Instance Right-Sizing
```yaml
optimization_strategy:
  baseline: "Measure current x86 resource utilization"
  mapping: "Select equivalent or better Graviton instances"
  validation: "Monitor performance and adjust sizing"
```

### Reserved Instance Strategy
```yaml
ri_approach:
  evaluation: "Calculate Graviton RI vs x86 On-Demand"
  commitment: "Start with 1-year terms for validation"
  scaling: "Increase commitment as confidence grows"
```

### Savings Plans Integration
```yaml
savings_plans:
  compute_plans: "Include Graviton in compute savings plans"
  ec2_plans: "Graviton-specific EC2 instance savings plans"
  lambda_plans: "ARM64 Lambda functions included"
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### CloudWatch Metrics
**Key Metrics to Monitor**:
- CPU utilization patterns
- Memory usage efficiency  
- Network performance
- Application-specific metrics

### Performance Monitoring
```yaml
monitoring_strategy:
  baseline: "Establish x86 performance baseline"
  comparison: "Side-by-side ARM64 vs x86 monitoring"
  optimization: "Track performance improvements over time"
```

## Service-Specific Migration Checklist

### Pre-Migration Validation
- [ ] Verify service supports ARM64/Graviton
- [ ] Check all dependencies for ARM64 compatibility
- [ ] Validate container images are ARM64-native
- [ ] Test application functionality on ARM64

### Migration Execution
- [ ] Update infrastructure templates (CDK/CloudFormation)
- [ ] Deploy ARM64 environment in parallel
- [ ] Validate performance and functionality
- [ ] Execute cutover plan

### Post-Migration Optimization
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Optimize for ARM64-specific features
- [ ] Adjust instance sizing based on actual performance
- [ ] Document lessons learned and best practices

This service patterns guide should be used alongside compatibility analysis and performance optimization to ensure successful Graviton migrations across all AWS services.
